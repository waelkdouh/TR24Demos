Exiting gateway sdk: https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-gateway-sdk

NodeJs Setup:
-------------
Listening at port 3000 using app.listen(3000)

Remember to add CORS to 

Dont run node index.js and run in debug mode as you will get an exception since both will be listenning to the sampe port. Run one or the other.

Created a nodejs debugging launch.json instead of a chrome specific one to hit the breakpoints.


Angular 2 setup:
----------------
Make sure to add the correct flag to chrome to allow remote debugging

Make sure to run npm start before you start debugging

Browsersync uses bs-config.json file to setup the server to listen to
 Local: http://localhost:8000
[1]     External: http://169.254.80.80:8000
[1]  --------------------------------------
[1]           UI: http://localhost:8001
[1]  UI External: http://169.254.80.80:8001


Remember to add   "ghostMode": false, under bs-config.json otherwise different browsers will be triggered at the same time which would cause multiple calls to the backend service.

Electron Setup:
---------------
Remember to use /// to point to local files by setting the <base href="file:///">

Cordova Setup:
---------------
CLI github repository:  https://github.com/apache/cordova-cli
---------------------------------------------------------------------
VERY IMPORTANT to place all the static assets under the WWW folder
Node_modules folder and app folders should go under the WWW folder
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Remeber that if you don't rebuild, the assets generated under android/assets will be resused. So either delete the folder explicitly or rebuild.

Either comment out the CSP or add the following in order to be able to execute inline Javascript code:

Add script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; to allow inline javascript

When downloading the code delete the platform and readd the platform to avoid getting an error when rebuilding.
